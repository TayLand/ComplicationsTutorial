# ComplicationsTutorial

For this tutorial, we are going to create an app that will read an array of bible references and display them on a timeline in a Modular Large complication.  

Begin with this tutorial:  
[http://techotopia.com/index.php/A_watchOS_2_Complication_Tutorial](http://techotopia.com/index.php/A_watchOS_2_Complication_Tutorial)

Make the following changes:

Replace timeLineText with a series of 4 - 5 bible verse references.  For now, just include the reference, e.g. John 3:16  

Replace the beer_glass icon with a more appropriate icon.  Check icon sizes here: [Icon Sizes](https://developer.apple.com/library/watchos/documentation/ClockKit/Reference/CLKComplicationTemplateModularLargeStandardBody_class/index.html)  

Replace the header text.

Modify the getTimelineEntriesForComplication function so it does not depend on the array size.
